Observable Trends:
1) The temperature increases as you approach the equator (0 latitude) and as such, there are hardly any cities near the extreme latitudes to either side, as nobody wants to live in a place as cold as antarctica full-time
2) Cloudiness and wind speed have almost no correlation with distance from equator
3) Many more cities have humidities above 50% than below
